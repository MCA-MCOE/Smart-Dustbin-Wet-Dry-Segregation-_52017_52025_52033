# Smart Dustbin - Wet and Dry Segregation

## Project Overview

The **Smart Dustbin** project aims to design and develop an automated waste segregation system for wet and dry waste. By incorporating IoT (Internet of Things) and smart sensors, the dustbin can differentiate between types of waste and automatically sort them into separate compartments, making waste management more efficient and eco-friendly. This project focuses on improving waste management systems in urban environments, promoting sustainability, and reducing manual labor.

## Features

- **Automatic Segregation**: The smart dustbin automatically detects and separates wet and dry waste using sensors and actuators.
- **IoT Enabled**: The dustbin can be connected to the internet to monitor waste levels and send notifications when it's full or requires attention.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A mobile app or a web interface provides real-time data on waste segregation status and bin capacity.
- **Environmentally Friendly**: This system helps improve waste management practices by promoting proper segregation, leading to more efficient recycling and composting.
- **Smart Alerts**: Sends alerts to municipal authorities when the bin is full or needs maintenance.

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino / Raspberry Pi for controlling the entire system.
- **Sensors**: 
  - Proximity Sensors (Ultrasonic or Infrared) for waste detection.
  - Moisture Sensors for identifying wet waste.
- **Actuators**: Servo motors for opening and closing waste compartments.
- **IoT**: Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module for communication with mobile apps or cloud platforms.
- **Mobile App**: Developed using Android / React Native for real-time monitoring and control.
